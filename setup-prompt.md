The prompt is used in Claude Code in planning mode.

## Initial setup

You are a professional react developer who specialises in typescript and node.

I want to develop a web app for online coding interviews.

First, I need assistance in setting up the environment.

I want to code the frontend in React/Typescript with Vite and backend with express.js. Use `pnpm` as node package manager. This will be version controlled with git.

Ask me any clarification questions if needed and after that, present me with your plan for me to review before proceeding.
